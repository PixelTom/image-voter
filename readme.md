# Image Voter

Feed images into the program and vote for your favourite.

I found I had a lot of images I save online for various game projects. So much that I have no idea how to sort them. So I decided to make this program to pit the images together like they were football teams. With an eventual winner (and top 10/20/etc).

Could also be useful for advertising and focus groups.

Currently still a WORK IN PROGRESS
